# Task Tracker Project

A **Task Tracker** project in **C#** is an application designed to help users **create, manage, and track tasks efficiently**. It allows users to:

- **Add tasks** with details like title, description, due date, and priority.
- **Update tasks** by changing status (e.g., pending, in progress, completed).
- **View tasks** in different categories such as active, overdue, or completed.
- **Delete tasks** that are no longer needed.
- **Exit the application** safely with a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental closures.
